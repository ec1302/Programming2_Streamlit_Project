# Programming2_Streamlit_Project

requirements.txt is a list of all packages used.

social_media_usage.csv is the data used for the logistic regression.

stdemo.py is the full Streamlit demo. It contains a simple logistic regression implemented with sklearn. The rest of the code uses 
the Streamlit package to create an interactive demo where you can input your own parameters into the logistic regression prediction. 

The link for the demo is:
